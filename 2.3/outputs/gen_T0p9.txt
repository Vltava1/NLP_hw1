Once upon a time, it turns out that most of the world's most important resources, like defense, air transportation, water, and mining, have to be accessed through a network of underground tunnels, tunnels, and tunnels to be mined and used for mining.

"Forcing the government and the military to use the same network is a grave danger," James Korsan, the former director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) told BBC News.
In the 21st century, as most countries of the world, like China and South Korea, make this kind of technological breakthrough, it's time for China to expand its military presence beyond its borders.
"How much has been lost over the last 40 years? What's the cost of acquiring the new technology?"
The military could provide the military with a range of resources from nuclear weapons to the mines, but they're not the only key for China to be in danger.
According to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), in addition to military resources, the United States would need to buy new technology to upgrade its military presence.
Of course, this new technology could be used to bolster the military's defense capabilities.
"At this time, there's been a lot of attention to the fact that China has to purchase a lot of equipment," James Korsan, the former director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) told BBC News.
"So to begin with, China is at an early stage of being a good ally in Central Asia, so it's hard to be overly harsh on China.
"The United States is already building a lot of equipment at a time where we might be getting more of the technology being deployed in Central Asia.
"In the world, we haven't gone as far as being clear as we might need to be on the ground to do more strategic things in the region."
