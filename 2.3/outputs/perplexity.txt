# Perplexity Analysis

Original paragraph:

Large language models have transformed natural language processing. They learn from vast corpora and
can perform a surprising variety of tasks. However, they sometimes hallucinate facts and require
careful evaluation. Researchers continue to study their limitations and opportunities. Responsible
deployment is crucial for real-world applications.
